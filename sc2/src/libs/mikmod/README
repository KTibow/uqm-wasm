NOTE by UQM developers: this is a modified version of libmikmod.

This version of the library is based on the official libmikmod library
version 3.3.11.1. Alterations have been marked with comments that
begin with the text UQM MOD, along with brief descriptions. The
changes are largely limited to removal of unused-by-UQM formats and
drivers, hardcoding static-library behavior for the remainder, and
reliance on UQM's own configuration files for cross-compatibility
defines.

The official library is found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mikmod.
